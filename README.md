👋 Hi, I’m Tony Kang :)
<br>
👀 I’m interested in mastering data and technology, especially database management, data analysis, and software engineering.
<br>
🌱 I’m currently learning SQL from scratch, as well as improving my skills in Python and cloud computing (AWS).
<br>
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data-driven projects, open-source contributions, or anything related to backend development.
